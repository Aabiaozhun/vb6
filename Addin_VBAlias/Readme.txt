A SMALL ADD-IN AS IDE ENHANCER FOR EVERY DAY

I use it since 2 years.

- Very confortable macros system, improved from Aivosto's Vb Friend. I didn't like the one in the AxTools.
- Automatic Space Enhancer.
- Option for start with maximized panes.
- Swap around equal.
- Comment/uncomment.
- clean immediate with a logic behaviour, the one mostly needed.
- And so on.


''''''''''''''

- fast loading.
- Solid and really safe hook. Used with a lot of others hooks running in the system on the same time.
- tested only under XP.
- the grid was made from scrach, no dep., by some unknown mexican fellow. "Gracias, Amigo!"
- fast way to set your macros: highlight the code portion to become a macro, right click, select "Fast macro", give in the short string an push on Save, faster to do as to explain, it was a lot of work, :). It saves a lot of typing. It comes preconfigured with the Aivosto macros.
- You can disable the hook. Refreshing the hook: disable an enable again. Can be necessary if you make crash your IDE with wrong hooks, :).
- Let me know abot improvements (and see also) .
Have fun!
