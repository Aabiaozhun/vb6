Description: A SMALL ADD-IN AS IDE ENHANCER FOR EVERY DAY
I use it since 2 years.
- Very confortable macros system, improved from Aivosto's Vb Friend. I didn't like the one in the AxTools.
- Automatic Space Enhancer.
- Option for start with maximized panes.
- Swap around equal.
- Comment/uncomment.
- clean immediate window with a logic behaviour, the one mostly needed.
- And so on.
